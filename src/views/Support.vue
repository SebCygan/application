 <p>
      If the student is agitated, angry or upset---- <br />Try to appear calm
      and in control of the situation, even if you don’t feel that way.<br />
      ● Allow the student space to talk about what is distressing them. If there
      is only limited time available, offer more time later. <br />● Discuss
      with the student where they can access support in the future. <br />● If
      the student is creating a disturbance or if you are concerned about your
      personal safety, contact Security on +44 (0)191 208 6817. <br />In an
      emergency, contact security on +44 (0)191 208 6666.

      <br /><br />Listening in the right time and space ● If the student appears
      to be agitated or upset, could a brief meeting be offered immediately?
      <br />● If you have an urgent deadline or an imminent appointment, say so
      and offer a specific time later. Alternatively, could the student be
      directed to someone who can offer time immediately? <br />● Make clear how
      much time is available. <br />● Try to ensure the time offered is free
      from interruptions and is in a private space. <br />
      ● Maintain a professional relationship e.g. do not give a student your
      private mobile phone number, avoid sharing personal details about
      yourself, maintain appropriate boundaries. Listening with purpose <br />
      ● What seems to be the main issue? <br />● Is this the whole story or are
      there other problems? <br />
      ● Is the issue having a major impact on the student’s wellbeing? <br />
      ● How does the student think/hope you can help them? <br />
      ● How do you think you can help the student as they might not know for
      themselves? <br />STAGE 1: Listen 4 Listening with skill <br />● Use open
      questions. <br />● Occasionally allow silences to last slightly longer
      than is comfortable. People need time and courage to find the right words.
      <br />● Check with the student that you have understood them correctly.
      <br />
      ● Reflect their words back to them to give them a chance to clarify or
      expand on something. <br />● Consider their body language and any recent
      behaviour changes you might have noticed. <br />● Do not be drawn into
      physical contact with the student. Making a record <br />● If you are
      going to make notes, explain to the student why you are doing this, even
      if it’s just to serve your own memory. <br />● You should make notes:
      <br />• if you think you will see the student again, so that you can
      remember what they have told you and/or track their progress <br />• if
      you think the student is at risk and you will need to (a) consult someone
      else about how to support them and (b) have evidence of what they told you
      and how you responded <br />● All notes should be kept securely; these may
      be requested under Freedom of Information, so be objective.

<p>
       <br />During your initial conversation with
      the student it is important to form an impression of how serious the
      situation is, as this will determine the action that you take. Having
      someone listen and take them seriously may be sufficient to defuse the
      situation and/or for the student to work out a course of action. On most
      occasions, although the situation may be very distressing for the student
      at the time, it will not be an urgent matter. <br />The following
      questions will help you to assess whether the situation is more serious.
      Questions to ask yourself<br />
      ● Is the student or other people at high risk of harm (e.g. self harm or
      suicide)? <br />● Is anyone else at risk through coercive behaviours (e.g.
      relationship abuse or initiations)?<br />
      ● Are the risks immediate?<br />
      ● Is specialist help required? <br />● Is there a need to act quickly?<br />
      ● Is there a need to inform or consult with someone else? A prompt
      response is required if:<br />
      ● a student may be at risk of hurting themselves or someone else <br />●
      their behaviour appears to be significantly out of character Discuss your
      concerns with your manager or with a member of the Student Health and
      Wellbeing Services by calling the Wellbeing Consultancy Service on +44
      (0)191 208 3333. See page 9 for further details.<br />
      If you think there is an immediate risk, call the emergency services
      directly, on 999 and then inform Security of the situation on +44 (0)191
      208 6666. Out of hours: If the concern cannot wait until the next working
      day please call Security on +44 (0)191 208 6817 who will take appropriate
      action.

      What can you do? <br />There may be practical things that you can do
      within your role which may help the student. <br />For example:<br />
      ● helping with academic adjustments <br />● arranging follow-up contact
      with the student <br />● helping to resolve conflict with other students
      Offer information Signposting – sharing information with the student about
      resources and services which you think might help them, and encouraging
      them to access these. The Student Health and Wellbeing Services website
      has links to a wide variety of resources and other online information and
      support, as well as emergency and out of hours contacts:
      www.ncl.ac.uk/students/wellbeing A student should be directed elsewhere
      for support when: <br />● the problem needs specialist help <br />● the
      problem is complex or serious <br />● the situation needs more time than
      you can offer <br />● the student appears to be at risk to themselves or
      others<br />
      ● the student is requesting support from a particular service <br />For
      example, if a student is a victim of a sexual crime and wants to report it
      to the police, they should ring 999 in an emergency, or 101 in a
      non-emergency. <br />Encourage the student to seek support from REACH, the
      local Sexual Assault Referral Centre; REACH staff offer support whether or
      not the student wishes to report the assault to the police and can be
      contacted on +44 (0)191 221 9222. <br />They can also receive support from
      Rape Crisis Tyneside and Northumberland on 0800 035 2794. Newcastle
      University is committed to providing a positive experience for our
      students and believe that abusive behaviours are never acceptable.
      <br />Our online Report and Support tool enables anyone to report concerns
      anonymously, make a formal complaint and/or receive support. If you have
      experienced or are aware of, sexual violence, sexual harassment or
      initiations behaviours affecting a Newcastle University student, you can
      report these directly to us via this tool: reportandsupport.ncl.ac.uk
      <br />Where a student is disturbing others or there are concerns about the
      student’s physical or mental wellbeing, but there does not appear to be an
      immediate risk, try to calm the student down by encouraging them to talk
      about what is distressing them, and then suggest where further help is
      available. <br />7 Making an appointment with the Student Health and
      Wellbeing Services Students can book an assessment appointment on our
      appointment site studenthealthandwellbeing.ncl.ac.uk or request an
      appointment by phoning us on +44 (0)191 208 3333.<br />
      During the assessment appointment, the range of possible support will be
      discussed with the student, depending on their particular needs.
      <br />This could include signposting to other specialist services, within
      the University and externally. So that students are seen as quickly as
      possible, encourage them to take the first assessment appointment they are
      offered, even if this means missing a lecture or a seminar.
      Confidentiality Confidentiality needs to be respected at all times and
      sensitive information shared only with the explicit informed consent of
      the student. <br />Confidentiality can be broken: <br />● when a student
      is alerting you to a clear and present danger to self or a third party
      i.e. suicide, radicalisation, domestic abuse, child abuse <br />● if there
      is an issue around child protection<br />
      ● disclosure of information relating to an act of terrorism or terrorist
      related activity If you are unsure about the best course of action, seek
      advice from your manager in the first instance.<br />A case can be
      discussed hypothetically without revealing names. If you are seriously
      concerned about a student’s welfare, you or they should contact the
      appropriate emergency services, see page 11 of this guide.

      This stage gives the student an opportunity to let you know of their
      progress and any additional support they might need. It also gives you an
      opportunity to check they are still on track, accessing support and taking
      any action that you agreed would be helpful. <br>Following up: <br>● should
      ideally be agreed in advance with the student so they know when and how
      you will follow up with them <br>● enables you to go home with a clear mind
      and you are both aware of your role in this situation <br>● relieves the
      pressure to have covered everything in the initial meeting. The time in
      between the initial interaction and the follow up gives you an opportunity
      to think a bit more about what might be useful and prepare for the student
      meeting <br>● can be done by phone, email or face-to-face. Use your judgment
      to decide what you think
