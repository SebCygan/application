        IMPORTANT: This page is specifically designed for when a member of staff
        has reason to believe a student has become a risk to themselves, in case
        of an emergency the best advice is to call 999. The following are also
        crisis team numbers for the Newcastle Upon Tyne area.
      </h3>
      <h5>Local NHS for NE Postcodes: 0303 123 1146</h5>
      <h5>Samaritans: 116 123</h5>
      <h5>
        If a student isn't sure where to go, they can phone 111 to be pointed in
        the right direction, also important to note this is what they should do
        if they are not registered with a GP in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne.
      </h5>
      <h5>
        You can get urgent help from any GP surgery without being registered as
        a patient, although you might need to register as a temporary patient if
        you need treatment over more than 24 hours.
      </h5>
      <h5>
        Students can get an emergency appointment for mental health with any GP
        in the area, they will normally be asked to attend as soon as posible,
        this is important for students needing urgent access to
        medication/support - crisis teams can only be accessed via referral
        which is often what happens in emergency mental health appointments
